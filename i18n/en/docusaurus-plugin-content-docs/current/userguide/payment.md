## How are fees calculated?

As a user, log in to <a href='https://cloud.mn'>cloud.mn</a> system and click on the **Calculator** Icon  in the upper right corner to enter the payment system. You can enter the resources you want to use and calculate how much the monthly payment will be.

  ![en-Payment-7](./img/payment/en-cloudmn-bill.png)

Cloud.mn operates on a Pay-As-You-Go model. In other words, you won't be charged when your virtual server is turned off. In this way, there are no more time and money-consuming things, such as preliminary high costs or contracts.
